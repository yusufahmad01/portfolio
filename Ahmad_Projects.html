                        <strong><p>Project</strong>: Scratch Project <br> 
                           <strong> Name of game </strong>: Raider Defense <br> 
                            <strong>Course </strong>: Computer Science/Software Engineering (P)<br>
                            <strong>Duration </strong>: August 29, 2017 - September 7, 2017 <br>
                            <strong>Objective </strong>: Using your knowledge of programming, design a game.<br>
                            <strong>Type of project </strong>: Partner Project <br> <br>
                            <p> The objective of this project was to use scratch blocks of code to design a game on <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/"> <strong>scratch</strong>,</a> using our knowledge of programming. We were given some guidelines for our fully functioning game, that can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BdMf1lx7jk2JU9g6VYKtg_QJu-HSAPLHc_1lxiZFd58/edit"> <strong>here</strong>.</a> This project was really fun becuase my partner and I were able to design our own game with our creativity. Though, this was a partner project, each partner had a specific role to do in the project. For me, my role was to record all documentation on the project log. It was my responsibility to document what we did in class and what we did at home. In addition, I was responsible for organizing the table of contents in the project log, as well as creating a flow chart of our diagram on <a href="https://www.draw.io/"> <strong>draw.io. </strong></a> Our project notebook can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PlMB42kMtp9oBVUtjcKn2wxUqYApsC6j7b0HbAB6Los/edit"><strong>here.</strong></a> In this research project, I learned a lot of great things. For instance, I learned how to use an 'if and then block' and how it can be incorporated into games. I also learned how math values and true and false statements can also be incorporated into games. In fact, as a result of these blocks of codes, I learned that this makes your game better and more enjoyable. Although, my partner and I were in a group, we faced a lot of challenges. Some challenges included not being able to program/code at the same time on scratch, using scratch blocks to code, and creating a game on such a small playable screen. I believe due to my leadership, my partner and I were able to succeed. I was open minded and observant for what was happening. When a problem occured, my partner and I worked together as a team and found a solution. He also was very cooperative, and as a result this lead to us being successful. I believe due to both of ours willingness to cooperate with one another, this allowed us to be successful and enabled us to have a great game on scratch.

                        <strong><p>Project</strong>: Python Text Adventure Project <br>

                            <strong>Course </strong>: Computer Science/Software Engineering (P)<br>
                            <strong>Duration </strong>: January 15th, 2018 - January 22nd, 2018 <br>
                            <strong>Objective </strong>: Using your knowledge of python, create a user interaction game that consists of mutiple acts.<br>
                            <strong>Type of project </strong>: Partner Project <br> <br>
                            <p> The objective of this project was to make a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)"><strong> python </strong></a>text adventure game that consisted of multiple acts on a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/"> <strong> cloud 9</strong></a> workspace. The guidelines are <a href"https://docs.google.com/document/d/17uB5HDyN2j5fksidQod9ylfnW7X1AhUOaF_3yDyf7C8/edit"> <strong> here.</strong></a> The project was a partner project as I worked with Avinash Obulareddy. My role in this project was to program 50% of the game, while he programmed the other 50% of the game. In addition, I was responsible for creating a flowchart on <a href="https://www.draw.io/"> <strong>draw.io. </strong></a> I was also responsible for defining functions and creating scene comments in the code editor to help make the code easier to understand and interpret. In this computer science project, I learned the difficulties of programming with python as it can be hard and difficult at times to program and fix errors in your code. Some challenges my partner, Avinash, and I overcame was learning the <a href="https://www.w3resource.com/python/python-syntax.php"><strong>syntax of python. </strong></a> Prior to the project we knew very little python, but we were still expected to create a python text adventure project. As a a result of knowing such little information about python, we really did not grasp the syntax of python to well. This led us to sometimes having errors we didn't understand, but we soon realized that the errors were due to syntax problems. Python syntax was just one of many problems we had overcame to make our project as successful as it is. In addition, another problem we overcame was the <a href="http://www.peachpit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1312792&seqNum=3"><strong>indentation of python </strong></a> as we that was a constant problem for us. Sometimes we were unable to correctly indent which led us to errors, however we started to learn the correct indentation of python which was crucial for the success of this project. In this project, I learned how to lead a team of 2 people, as a leader of the project I assigned roles to both my partner and I which contributed to the success of this project. In addition, I learned the importance of having equal work as it can lead to more success. As a result of having a good partner like Avinash I was able to split the work and work faster which led us to be more productive.</p>
