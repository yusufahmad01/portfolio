                        <strong><p>Project</strong>: Scratch Project <br> 
                           <strong> Name of game </strong>: Raider Defense <br> 
                            <strong>Course </strong>: Computer Science/Software Engineering (P)<br>
                            <strong>Duration </strong>: August 29, 2017 - September 7, 2017 <br>
                            <strong>Objective </strong>: Using your knowledge of programming, design a game.<br>
                            <strong>Type of project </strong>: Partner Project <br> <br>
                            <p> The objective of this project was to use scratch blocks of code to design a game on <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/"> <strong>scratch</strong>,</a> using our knowledge of programming. We were given some guidelines for our fully functioning game, that can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BdMf1lx7jk2JU9g6VYKtg_QJu-HSAPLHc_1lxiZFd58/edit"> <strong>here</strong>.</a> This project was really fun becuase my partner and I were able to design our own game with our creativity. Though, this was a partner project, each partner had a specific role to do in the project. For me, my role was to record all documentation on the project log. It was my responsibility to document what we did in class and what we did at home. In addition, I was responsible for organizing the table of contents in the project log, as well as creating a flow chart of our diagram on <a href="https://www.draw.io/"> <strong>draw.io. </strong></a> Our project notebook can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PlMB42kMtp9oBVUtjcKn2wxUqYApsC6j7b0HbAB6Los/edit"><strong>here.</strong></a> In this research project, I learned a lot of great things. For instance, I learned how to use an 'if and then block' and how it can be incorporated into games. I also learned how math values and true and false statements can also be incorporated into games. In fact, as a result of these blocks of codes, I learned that this makes your game better and more enjoyable. Although, my partner and I were in a group, we faced a lot of challenges. Some challenges included not being able to program/code at the same time on scratch, using scratch blocks to code, and creating a game on such a small playable screen. I believe due to my leadership, my partner and I were able to succeed. I was open minded and observant for what was happening. When a problem occured, my partner and I worked together as a team and found a solution. He also was very cooperative, and as a result this lead to us being successful. I believe due to both of ours willingness to cooperate with one another, this allowed us to be successful and enabled us to have a great game on scratch.
